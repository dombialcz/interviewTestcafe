### Part 1 - run the code, review the code

Having only nodejs installed can you run the tests?

Can you review the code and leave meaningful comments?

 There are rules when it comes to writing good automation code. 
 Do you know what page object pattern is? How do you apply it?
 Do you know the good practice principles for automation and for javascript/typescript code?
 
 
 ### Part 3 - get coding
 
 (tests/part3_create.ts) 
 What is going on in your head when you write code? Can you use what you've seen in previous
 two parts to design an automated test scenario?
